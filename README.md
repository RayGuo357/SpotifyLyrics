# Spotify-Lyrics Player

Utilizes a RESTful API between a React frontend and Express.js backend server. The React frontend provides an interface that allows the user to perform basic Spotify actions such as pausing, resuming, skipping, and reversing songs. The frontend communicates with the backend which then communicates with the Spotify and Genius API to get information and scrape lyrics from Genius's webpage.
